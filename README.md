Chrome Parameters
=================

A chrome extension that shows parameters from the URL

** Important update ** 
So tried to upload version 1.6, but unfortunately it keeps being rejected by the store, because i'm using too broad permissions. 
Tried to explain what the problem was (that the purpose of the extension is to parse url data, so this is why it need access to all sites) but looks like who is doing the reviews only reply with template answers and doesn't help me in identifying answers (i already sent them more than 6 or 7 emails, and not sure if i will do it again, so for now chrome version will be available only on github until further notice. For the firefox version instead i need to make a suitable logo before submitting it to the firefox addon store!

Install from [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/parameters-viewer/jcfdalmioobeifbpcgjghhaifimaeaca) 

How to contribute
-----------------

If you want to contribute to the extension you can do it in many different ways. 

Just using it is a way to contribute, since you are just giving me motivation to develop it further.

If you want to be more actively involved you can: 

* Report issues/feedback - this is very important to help me to improve the extension and match users needs. So if you face any problem, or you want to give us your feedback on something that you want to be improved, or just ask a new feature feel free to open an issue! 
* Contribute with code: you can also contribute with some code, in this case just go to the issues section, and search for anything you want to work on, just say that you want to work on it, and when your updates are ready just open a pull request. If you are new to the project, or you don't feel that you have enough skills to work on bigger task, you can serch for the issues labelled with: <b>good-first-issue</b> usually these issues requires very little coding, and are very easy to fix, but they help you to become confident with the code.
